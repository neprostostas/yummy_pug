## 🍫 Tips from Yummy

Eating a piece of chocolate not only adds a few extra calories but can boost your mood and brain function! Always opt for dark chocolate with high cocoa content. It has fewer fats and sugars compared to milk chocolate and is rich in magnesium, calcium, iron, protein, antioxidants, and vitamins.

Here are some other sweets recommended by Yummy:

- Dark Chocolate 🍫
- Marshmallow 🍥
- Fruit Jelly 🍇
- Marmalade 🍊
- Honey 🍯
- Halva 🥜
- Candied Fruits 🍬

# INSTRUCTION
A set of files for automatic compilation of .pug templates into html files.

To get started, you need to have Node.js installed (with its npm manager) - https://nodejs.org/en/

After installing Node.js via the command line, you need to globally install the Gulp manager with the command
```
npm i gulp -g
```

After that, you can work with the starter package for processing Pug files, which includes a customized gulp manager for compiling pug to html. Note that all files from the <b>app/pug</b> folder in <b>app/html</b> will be compiled, including subdirectories except for the <b>app/pug/includes</b> folder
(Intended for basic templates and general page blocks).

To start autocompilation in the project folder, you need to open the command line and write the command:<br>
```
gulp watch
```

After that, gulp-manager will automatically track changes in pug files and compile them into html. The command prompt should remain open. Moreover, in the case of errors in the code, compilation will not occur, and instead, error information will be displayed on the command line.
